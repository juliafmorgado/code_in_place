# code_in_place

Code in Place 2021 was an endeavour by a group of educators and volunteer teachers from all over the world to teach introductory programming to over 12,000 students. Based on Stanford University's CS 106A, the course taught the fundamentals of programming in Python.

We were taught Control Flow, Python Expressions, and functions. In addition to that, we had a brief introduction to python's simple image library to work on image processing. Python data structures like lists, tuples, dictionaries working with files comprised were also taught perfectly. 

Each week we were given assignments and I've pushed them to GitHub.
